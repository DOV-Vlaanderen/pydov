v2.1.0
------

* News

  * This version adds support for Python 3.9.

  * This version is supported on Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9.

  * We are proud to be a part of the growing `pyOpenSci <https://www.pyopensci.org/>`_ community promoting open and reproducible research.

* New features

  * Add support for location-based searching using vectorfiles (f.ex. Shapefile, Geopackage) and Geopandas dataframes.

  * Add new object type for groundwater permits (GrondwaterVergunning)

  * Add new object types for soil data, including:

    * Soil sites (Bodemsite)

    * Soil plots (Bodemlocatie)

    * Soil samples (Bodemmonster)

    * Soil observations (Bodemobservatie)

* Fixes and improvements

  * Fix bugs that occur when the XML webservice is unavailable, i.e. prevent caching errors and return stale data if available.

  * Retry failed network requests to make pydov more resilient to bad network connections.

  * Switched from the main DOV WFS endpoint to workspace-level endpoints, this is more efficient and allows a cleaner codebase.

  * Add the `start_interpretatie_mtaw` field to the interpretatie types.

  * Add the `mv_mtaw` field to the Sondering type.

v2.0.1
------

* Fixes and improvements

  * Fix the korrelvolumemassa, volumemassa and watergehalte fields of Grondmonster type.

  * Add the 'mv_mtaw' field to the GrondwaterFilter type.

  * Extend the hooks system and distinguish between read and inject hooks. The 'xml_requested' hook has been removed in favor of 'xml_received'.

  * Generate stable WFS GetFeature requests, allowing f.ex. hooks to reuse cached responses.

* Development-only updates

  * Retype the `meetnet_code` field of GrondwaterFilter from integer to string.

  * Pin the dependencies to keep explicit Python2 support.

* Development-only updates

  * Make the DOV base URL configurable to be able to test against the DOV testing environment.
