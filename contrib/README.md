# Contributions

Welcome to the contribution section of the pydov repository! This section
includes scripts and tools made by contibutors (you!) that might benefit others too.

## Add yours!

If you made a script using pydov that you think might also be useful for others,
don't hesitate to open a pull request to add it here!

The minimum to provide besides the script itself is:
- a README.md containing minimal information on what it does and how to use it
- a requirements.txt if your script requires additional dependencies

## Disclaimer

The scripts and tools provided here are not maintained by the pydov core team
and do not require the same level of code quality and test coverage as the
pydov core modules.
